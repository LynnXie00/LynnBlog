# Mini-series according to the book -如果长月烬明按原著拍

I'm a fan of the novel that this drama is adapted from. I'm not super fond of the way the drama is made so I'm re-editing it according to the novel. It's okay if you never watched this show, since I'm technically making it into a mini drama. 我读完小说很喜欢, 觉得这部剧很可惜，完全就毁在编剧和剪辑上了，其实演员的颜值演技和服装美术总体问题都不大。所以趁着周末一时兴起想用短剧的方式重新打开这部剧，删去那些编剧作死的有的没的剧情，重新带大家看看原著里面的各个角色是怎样的。 已经在有限素材下尽可能往原著方向贴了，完全一样是不太可能……

## Ep 2: Secrets  秘密

This episode is the chapter 8-24's content. I had to skip those plot that the drama doesn't have... and added a few female recordings (yes that's me sometimes who speaks as Li Susu) 这一集是黑月光第8章到第24章的内容。没有素材的地方只好跳过了，有些实在不能跳的就自己补了点录音

## Ep 3: World-Alluring Jade 倾世之玉


![type:video](https://youtu.be/aufBTuKBwxs)

This episode is chapter 25-34 in the book. Or course I have to skip a lot of content because of lack of footage. The drama changed some settings in the book, I have to combine these two... For instance, World-alluring Jade is actually World-alluring Flower in the book, and the Gou Yu, a magic bracelet with its own will, has been removed from the drama. Ye Xiwu escaped many many times from Tanti Jin, but the drama combined them into once. The Succubus and the peach tree spirit has been merged into one demon by the drama, etc. 本集是原书25-34章的内容。当然同样因为素材不足省略了很多东西。有一些剧里对原作设定的改动，我只好两边都杂糅着来。比方说电视剧把倾世花改成了倾世之玉，被删掉的有神识的法器勾玉，叶夕雾的多次逃跑合并为一次，梦妖和桃花妖合并成一个妖怪等。 I'm editing my series following the main story of FL's time-traveling to save her world. It's sad that this dram has been edited in a way to emphasize romance, sometimes the romance plot feels awkward to me. This story have better meanings. Now I've removed the parts I feel awkward about, and now I like it. 我主要是遵从女主穿越救世的主线来剪，剪的过程中更加觉得这部剧十分可惜，因为本来可以是立意很高的设定，结果硬是加了很多恋爱脑尬戏份。我现在把这些看得脚趾抠地的部分剪掉，就发现不少可圈可点的地方了。

## Ep 4: Dream of Bo're Life 般若浮生


![type:video](https://youtu.be/1W8yBnqdyfo)

This episode is the dream of Bo're Life. I made the video extra foggy because it's in a dream. The drama deviates more and more from the book now, that's why I recorded my own voice a lot LOL. But Bo're Life is still the best part of the drama, stick most to the book. The book though, only have one or two chapters of this part. The drama's changes are: they let Mingye love Sang Jiu very early, and his eyes recovered earlier too. It seems sweeter, but I don't know how the drama can explain Sang Jiu's later hatred. In the book, it's a typical "girl made a lot of effort at the beginning and then left, then the boy tried to find the girl back" story. In the book, Sang Jiu never told Mingye the River-calming crystal is inside his body, because the lost of the crystal made so many spirits die, and Mingye is on his path to become a God, which means he needs to have a pure heart without guilt. She thought Mingye never love her, and that's why she could not tell later Mingye changed his attitude. 第四集是般若浮生。我把这一集弄得很模糊，因为是梦里啊。其实越到后面改得越多，所以我的录音越来越多（笑.但般若浮生这一段依然是最还原的。小说里这一段是寥寥带过，电视剧里主要的改动是，让冥夜一开始就喜欢桑酒，并且眼睛提前复原。好像是更甜了，但这就不太好解释为啥后来连着冥夜一起恨。原著这一段就是典型的前期女方卑微付出，后面追其火葬场。桑酒不愿意说冥夜害漠河失去镇水印芯所以生灵伤亡，因为冥夜要成神所以需心中不亏不欠，她觉得冥夜对她从未有情，也就看不出后来冥夜的变化

## Ep 5: Hatred 恨意


![type:video](https://youtu.be/2apDvF6auQo)

This episode finishes the dream of Bo're Life. I used AI to speak for some male characters LOL. Also, because the drama merged Sang Jiu's brother Sang You and Shao Qing ( a wolf spirit who loves Sang Jiu) into one character, I have to also merge them. So I made Sang You an adopted brother of Sang Jiu, who loves Sang Jiu secretly. 这集就是单纯讲完了般若浮生的内容。有一些比较关键的台词跳不过去只好让AI说了，凑活一下吧。由于电视剧的素材把桑酒哥哥桑佑和暗恋桑酒的狼妖少雎合并成了一个人了，我剪的时候也只好把他俩算作一个人，就当作，伪骨科之类的设定吧，好像更好磕了。这集难得使用了原剧的ost, 发现真的好好听哦。

## Ep 6: Feelings 心意


![type:video](https://youtu.be/EyU0xwqPHWw)

This episode is chapter 47 to 62 in the book. Tantai Jin gradually developed some romantic feelings towards Ye Xiwu after he got out of the dream of Bo're Life. I noticed that the drama changed Bingchang's stories a lot, that's why I can't include her part into my video... About the event that Ye Xiwu killed Xiao Lin, I'm disappointed that the drama didn't event have a flashback for these two. Xiao Lin will be Li Susu' classmate in the same school, and he's also a brother in the Bo're Life (he also loves Sang Jiu in the book), and Tantai Jin bewitched her to kill him with her own hands. Of course she'll hate Tantai Jin to the uttermost. I like of kind the chemistry between Xiao Lin and Ye Xiwu when I did the editing LOL. 这一集是小说47-62章，是澹台烬逐渐心动，以及利用叶夕雾刺杀萧凛。没有素材的就只好跳过了。我发现电视剧没怎么拍叶冰裳原著的戏码，而是加了好多典型恶毒女配的戏份……所以叶冰裳的部分我基本没法剪进去了。电视剧关于这部分我也是刚看，很失望的是竟然没有来个bgm渲染一下刺杀那里，可能是电视剧主要要拆萧凛x叶夕雾这一对。萧凛在后世世是黎苏苏师兄，第二师是暗恋和陪伴桑酒的少雎（剧里改成桑佑了），澹台烬让她亲手杀他，她肯定恨得不行，男主真的不做人。我剪着剪着有点磕女主和男二，回头看看要不剪一个他俩的。

## Ep 7: Nine Spikes Out 神钉出

![type:video](https://youtu.be/wSMtnvvP6MU)

This is a bitter-sweet episode...for chapter 62-70 in the book everyone's suffering.. 这一集真是又甜又虐……剪前面我觉得澹台烬真惨，剪后面我觉得黎苏苏真惨。以及bgm玄鸟好好听。这一集叶冰裳戏份多了点，因为她要搞事了。书里是个复杂的人物，唯一在宫斗的人。书里澹台烬化出9根追魂钉的时候是舍身替叶夕雾挡箭的时候，结果叶夕雾在那当下马上给他钉钉子，他好惨……结春蚕的设定我又捞回来了。书里是要每月那啥的药物，但女主因为一直戴着一个抗毒的宝物所以没事了。后来被澹台烬拿走了。总之刺杀失败后女主就不断身心受折磨，心里愧疚，每月被结春蚕，眼睛也慢慢看不见了，好惨。都惨，都惨。

## Ep 8: Shattering 碎裂

![type:video](https://youtu.be/vHIG59ViGpU)

This episode is for chapter 71-81 in the book, a lot of sorrow and memories....I usually just pick one of the chapter titles as my video title, and this time "shattered" really includes a lot: what is shattered? The love-and-hate past between TTJ and YXW, the magic bracelet for both confinement and protection, Ye Xiwu's body after jumping off the towel...Out of story-telling purpose I didn't put Ye Bingchang's ending into this video, also because it's too bloody: her arms and legs were cut off... Also, Tantai Jin's hairs were supposed to turn white after Ye Xiwu's death, but I don't have enough skills to do that cool effect LOL. Also, Yue Fuya is a guy, not a girl as the drama changed his gender, so I used Huhan's clips for this character LOL. 这一集是原著71至81章，很多虐心和回忆……我通常用原书的章节标题作为视频标题，而这一章的标题感觉涵盖了很多：碎裂，什么碎裂了呢？两人爱恨交织的过往，代表束缚和守护的凫茈镯，叶夕雾从城楼下落的尸身……出于故事流畅度的原因，我没有把叶冰裳的结局剪出来，而且做成人彘有点过于血腥了。还有澹台烬在叶夕雾跳城楼后白发了，特效水平有限就做不出来。500年后的月扶崖是男性，电视剧性转了，我诚邀了鹿晗来出演2333 还会有下一集吗？我试试看吧……毕竟从下面开始电视剧就胡改了……

## Ep 9: Meeting Again 再遇


![type:video](https://youtu.be/r8Kai0Y40-Y)
这一集是原著82至92章，由于电视剧从这里开始就大改了，我只好用了大量的AI配音……关键是画面素材没有啊。所以我剪得非常勉强……如果没看过原著的话可能就完全看不懂了 Let me explain the story here: Tantai Jin wanted to revive Ye Xiwu, so he worked very hard to fight in the immortal competition, to win the Soul-calming lamp, which can help searching people's soul. He also wanted to kill Li Susu because her spiritual body is said to be the best body for a soul of a person who's dead before. But he didn't know Li Susu is Ye Xiwu. So TTJ controlled Cen Mixuan's body to attach LSS. Later, they both entered the Cangyuan Secret Realm: Li Susu need another magic artifact, since Gou Yu's gone. Li Susu met Tantai Jin in the Illusionary Stone Array and saw TTJ's illusions: how he miserably searched someone's soul. But she thought TTJ was looking for Ye Bingchang.'s soul, out of her last impression 500 years ago. When Li Susu and Yue Fuya was attacked by some strange vines, TTJ took this opportunity to attack them, but at that moment, the mirror of the past showed to both of them their past, and that's how TTJ got to know, Li Susu is Ye Xiwu. Afterwards, the strange vine pulled both of them to the bottom of the mountain, and there's another secret realm there. Being wounded, Li Susu lost her memory and become a little girl. A child with a simple heart can see through everything, so she easily told that Tantai Jin actually liked her, instead of hating her. She promised TTJ to forgive him and start over, but after getting out of the secret realm, all she remembered was, they were attacked by TTJ... so she also hurt him as a defense. Then the demons came to attack the immortals. TTJ used all his strength to fought, and LSS cured him, though she's also severely injured. She asked TTJ's sect brother not to tell him, but TTJ was smart enough to tell the truth. After that, in order to rescue TTJ's professor and LSS's sect brother, they met in the human world again... 澹台烬想要复活叶夕雾，所以他在仙门大比赢得了安魂灯，用来寻找已死之人的魂魄。同时他看上了黎苏苏的天生灵体，因为据说是死人魂魄最好的容器。 他并不知道黎苏苏就是叶夕雾，所以他控制岑觅璇的身体来袭击黎苏苏。后来他们都进入了苍元秘境：黎苏苏是为了找一个新的法器，因为勾玉在500年前已经用掉了。苍元秘境中，黎苏苏在石林幻阵里见到了澹台烬，看见了澹台烬的幻觉是在鬼哭河里苦苦寻找某人的魂魄，但她以为澹台烬寻找的是叶冰裳，因为500年前最后的印象。 后来，在黎苏苏和师弟月扶崖被某个怪藤袭击的时候，澹台烬趁机偷袭了他们，却在那时候让过去镜照出了前尘往事，确认了黎苏苏就是叶夕雾。那之后怪藤把他俩拉下悬崖，黎苏苏受伤和变成了小孩，失忆了。拥有纯净心灵的孩子能一眼看透事物，所以她能看出来澹台烬其实很喜欢她，而不是恨她。作为孩子，她答应澹台烬原谅他，重头来过。但从秘境除了以后她又什么都不记得了，只记得她被澹台烬偷袭的事情，于是又一掌伤到了澹台烬……后来邪魔来袭，澹台烬用尽力气反击，黎苏苏也协助她，后来还尽力治疗他，尽管自己也是重伤。她不让澹台烬的师兄告诉他是谁救治了他，但澹台烬很聪明所以能猜出来。后来，为了救出被魔界人带走的公冶师兄和澹台烬的师父，他们都去往了人间，并在那里相逢……
