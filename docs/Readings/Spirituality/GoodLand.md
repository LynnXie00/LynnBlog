This book makes me love the genre "memoirs". It is a book full of pains, disappointments, and confusions about church and faith in America, with an interesting context: after Trump got elected as the President. I would call it "traumatic writing" because I feel the author is basically licking her wounds.  
  
Her confusion is also my confusion: how can Church, the place for the sacred and love does the opposite. Gradually I learned to separate the Church from churches, separate God's will from the church's will, God's words from pastors' preachingâ€¦ and even if people do things in God's name, it doesn't mean that God's spirit is with them.  
  
As a person sharing similar views and similar wounds, I often cried as I read this book. In fact, my feeling towards faith is very similar to what she felt at the end of the book, not knowing what to believe, but still can't let go because of the deep impact faith once had in our lives.
