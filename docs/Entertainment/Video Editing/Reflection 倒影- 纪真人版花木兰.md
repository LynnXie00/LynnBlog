# Reflection 倒影- 纪真人版花木兰
![type:video](https://youtu.be/V5F_c3TJe88)

真人版花木兰，是刘亦菲所有的电影作品中我最喜欢的一部。它不是完美的，但它的好没有被很多人看到。这部电影可以被浅显地理解为合家欢的公主片，但它又充满了隐喻。我在剪这个影片的时候数次流泪：我赋予了这个剪辑我自己的感情和经历。 Mulan (2020) is my favorite movie out of all Yifei's movies. It is, of course, not perfect, but it's often misunderstood and thus underrated. Yes, you can view it as a simple Disney family movie, but it's also full of metaphors for the real world. I cried several times when I edited this clip: it reflects my own emotions and experiences. “气”，可以看作是任何能力，就是那种男孩子拥有就会被赞赏，但放在女孩子身上就会被贬低的东西。多少类似的话语被理所当然地说出：“女孩子读那么多书做什么”，“女孩子长太多肌肉不好看”，“女孩子数学不好”， “女博士是第三种人类”。木兰，正如我们所有女性，年纪渐长被社会定义性别的时候，所受到的教育也开始区别于男性，“女生要安静，沉稳，优雅，嫁个好人家”。但当她以男性身份加入军营后，却被鼓励“培养天赋”，追求力量，学习团队协作。在远离原生家庭后，她在从前的社会环境里压抑自我的创伤，逐渐在众人欣赏的目光中被治愈。但在最后荣归故里后，木兰的父亲为他大男子主义的傲慢而道歉，这个结局真的过于理想和美好，所以这才是造梦的迪士尼。 Chi, can be seen as any capabilities, the ones that would be appreciated if owned by man, but despised if owned by a woman. So many words like these were spoken without a second thought: "girls don't need to study as hard, " "muscles don't look good on girls' legs/arms", "girls are not good at STEM", "a female phd belongs to the third kind of human". Mulan, just like all of us, growing up being identified by her gender, receiving a completely different set of education: "girls need to be quiet, composed, graceful, and be a good wife in the future." But when she joined the army as a man, she's encouraged to "cultivate her gift" instead of "hiding it away, " and she's taught to pursue power and coordinate with a team. After being away from her family, her trauma of suppressing her gift gradually got healed by the appreciation of her mentors and friends. At the end, when she came back home with honor, her father apologized for his poisonous ”man-like" pride. This is such an ideal and happy ending, and that's why Disney is said to create dreams. 电影里一个有意思的设定，也是我自己所认同的价值，就是，只有真实的，才是有力量的。多少女性为了不被社会对女性的期待所定义，便去扮演男性：“我是个女汉子”是很多女性有意无意地自我定位。我认为这部真人版电影就是围绕《倒影 Reflection》这首歌而创作的。做真实的自己，尤其对东亚文化下的我们这一代，是多么需要一直练习的事情啊。接纳自己的性别，容貌，性向，性情。每一次决意自我接纳，都需要像木兰被女巫射穿胸膛那样死去且涅槃。尽管Reflection的乐器版本没有歌词，我也为这首耳熟能详的歌在屏幕上打上了无声的歌词。 An interesting point in the movie, which is also my own value: the most true is the most powerful. So many women, in order not to be defined by the gender stereotype, claim that they're "man-like." I think this movie is made surrounding the theme song "reflection." To be ones true self, especially to those of us who grew up in Asian culture, is something need to be practiced on a daily basis. Accept our own gender, body shape, sexual orientation, personality, etc. Each time when you decide to accept yourself, you need to suffer and reborn, just like how Mulan got killed by the witch and revived. Therefore, even though the instrumental version of [Reflection] has no lyrics, I typed the lyrics as you might want to sing along. 电影里另外一些有意思的地方: - 尽管是2020年的电影，里面已经塑造了”普信男“的形象了，看来这是个中西皆存在的现象。 - 对很多男人来说，聪明勇敢幽默的女性不是女性，只有肤白貌美会做家务的才是。 - 很多时候，压迫女性的，恰恰是另一些女性。
